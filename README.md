Here we have investigated gene expression overlap between different cell populations in the mouse spinal cord from [(Häring et al 2018)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0141-1). This information can be informative when dissecting spinal cord sensory circuits, which we have done in this review article.
